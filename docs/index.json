Alien Worlds is currently in open beta testing phase (currently available for Android users only).\nWhat is Alien Worlds Tokenomics? Alien Worlds Tokenomics is an ecosystem designed to incentivize and reward developers, gamers, and content creators in a way that has never been seen before.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new form of digital asset that is used to represent ownership of an object or collectible. NFTs are not interchangeable and can be used as a form of currency, to track ownership, or to identify the owner. They are created on the blockchain and can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.\nThis article will walk you through What Ethereum Tokens are, How NFT Works, How NFTs and Blockchain Related to each other and Their Potential Uses in Gaming.\nWhat is an Ethereum Token? An Ethereum token is a digital asset that can be traded, transferred, or sold. The most popular use of an Ethereum token is to represent a tradable asset. Ethereum tokens are created using smart contracts. They are based on the ERC-20 standard and they have a few common features:\nThey are fungible, meaning they can be freely exchanged without any difference in value between the tokens; They are divisible, meaning they can be split into smaller units;\nThey have a limited supply that cannot be changed; Only their creator has the power to create new tokens and destroy them.\nHow Do NFTs Work in Games? NFTs are one of the most interesting and important applications of blockchain technology. They offer a new way for people to interact with games, but also a new way for players to have ownership over the items they collect in games.\nCryptocurrency games are a relatively new phenomenon that is on the rise. The idea is that players can buy, sell, and trade in-game items using cryptocurrencies instead of fiat money. This means that you can use your Bitcoin or Ethereum to purchase something in a game like CryptoKitties or Ethermon.\nEthereum Games are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and require ether (ETH) as an input to generate an output (e.g., an item). It’s important to note that these games do not require ETH as an input (rather, they require ETH as an output).\nNFTs and Blockchain Gaming – How Are They Related? NFTs and Blockchain Gaming are both part of the new wave of gaming technology. They are concepts that have been around for a while, but these technologies have never been available to the wider public until now.\nThe relationship between NFTs and Blockchain gaming is a bit more complicated. Cryptokitties, an Ethereum game that went viral because of the popularity of the digital collectibles it uses, is not just any game. It has a level of depth that is unheard of in most other games.\nCryptokitties allows players to buy  and sell these digital collectibles for fiat money as well as for cryptocurrency. Inventory and contract ownership are both recorded on the blockchain- this means that players can buy, sell, trade and exchange their precious kitties easily without having to trust one another or worry about fraud or theft.Players are also able to create new cryptokitties with genetic information pulled from the blockchain itself, something that other game designers can’t do with NFTs.\nWhat You Should Know About NFTs and Their Uses in Games NFTs stands for non-fungible tokens, which are tokens that represent individual units or collectibles with intrinsic and specific value. They are a very attractive concept as they introduce new ways to monetize games and gaming content. On the other hand, NFTs were recently introduced in Ethereum protocol that can be used to store every type of digital asset in one place on the blockchain.\nPeople create their accounts in Ethereum\u0026rsquo;s public ledger to issue their NGs like shares of stocks or bonds. Their transactions take a fraction of a cent and there are very few fees involved to the token creators; if you care about reducing the costs for your transactions, this is something that you should take into consideration.\nWant to start playing?

NFTs are new digital assets that have a particular rarity, utility, and other parameters. These properties make them valuable to collectors and gamers alike.\nThe idea is that when a user first acquires their NFT, the token is assigned a fixed value. Throughout its lifetime, the value of the NFT changes depending on how it’s used by its owner or traded on an open market.\nNon-Fungible Tokens and Popular Games Currently on the Market In this section, we will discuss some reasons why you should invest in Non-Fungible Tokens and some ways to invest as well as some popular games that currently have these tokens.\nPeople are investing in NFTs because they believe that it\u0026rsquo;s the future and that one day they will be able to use them as a form of currency. There is also a limited chance of obtaining certain types of items because there can only be one owner per item at a time which makes them more valuable. With this, it is important to acquire items before they disappear and make the most out of them in order to maximize profits.\nOn the other hand, the most popular games currently in the market that are utilizing NFTS are CryptoKitties, and Decentraland.\nCryptoKitties is a game for those who want to breed virtual kitties with each other and collect them as they grow up. It was built on Ethereum’s blockchain and makes use of their non-fungible tokens (NFT). Decentraland on the other hand is an open world where players can interact with others in a virtual environment.\nHow will this latest trend impact the future of gaming? Blockchain is the latest trend in gaming. As a result, there are a number of conferences that have been created to cover this new technology and its potential impact on the future of gaming.\nThe Blockchain Game Developers Conference 2019 is one such conference that has been created to discuss blockchain’s potential impact on game development. Participants will be able to learn about how blockchain can be used in games, how it differs from other technologies like VR and AR, and what types of games can benefit from blockchain. Blockchain technology has the potential to change the way we play games by changing the way we buy  and sell digital items through “digital wallets” that are not controlled by a central authority.\nConclusion: What are your thoughts about the future of non-fungible tokens and gaming? There is a lot of speculation about the future of non-fungible tokens and gaming. There are many different uses for them including in games, cryptocurrency, trading cards and collectible. As technology advances, it’s going to be interesting to see what new ways we will find to use these tokens.\nThe biggest question that we have is if these tokens will become more mainstream or if they will continue to be a niche interest. Either way, there is no doubt that people are very excited about these types of assets and the potential for what might come next!\nWant to start playing?

Non-fungible tokens are in-game items that are unique, meaning that each one is assigned a distinct identity. Unlike traditional video game items, NFTs cannot be broken down into smaller parts and players cannot trade them with other players.\nNon-fungible tokens have many applications outside of just games. They can be used to create a digital art collection without the hassle of storing the physical goods or tracking when an item changes hands. They can also be used in different forms of digital collectibles such as cryptokitties and rare pepe cards.\nWhat are the potential investment opportunities in NFT games? Non-Fungible Tokens are unlike utility tokens. They are built on top of some other existing platform  that supports the development that enables users to trade and own their tokens. NFTs are similar to cryptocurrencies in the way they offer an open and transferable token, but there is a difference.\nNFTs don\u0026rsquo;t have a fungible value, which means that one token cannot be substituted for another of identical characteristics (i.e., one digital collectible card can\u0026rsquo;t replace another digital collectible card). In short, they\u0026rsquo;re assets with a unique identity which make them valuable to the owner. Investment opportunities come as various types of assets may develop over time, including but not limited to: game studios, game development tools and hardware, non-fungible tokens issued on blockchain platforms, esport teams and leagues.\nRecent Trends in Cryptoeconomics \u0026amp; How They Impact Gaming Cryptoeconomics is a field emerging from crypto games that uses game theory and economics to design fair mechanisms for incentivizing desired behaviors. This can range from placing high scores on a leaderboard to catching more Pokémon’s. The key to cryptoeconomics is that it can create systems in which the participants are incentivized to act in the way that the game designer desires. These systems can be incredibly complex, but the basic idea is that players are rewarded for desirable actions and punished for undesirable actions.\nOne of the most important aspects of cryptoeconomics is that the incentives are transparent. Players know exactly what they need to do to receive rewards and they know what will happen if they act in an undesirable way. This helps to ensure that the game is fair and that players are not taking advantage of the system. Cryptoeconomics is still a relatively new field, and there are many unexplored possibilities. However, it has already shown promise in helping to create fair and engaging games.\nNon-Fungible Tokens as an Asset Class \u0026amp; Potential Investment Opportunities Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new kind of cryptocurrency that is used in video games. The tokens represent an asset or item that cannot be used by someone else. NFTs are not fungible because they can be customized to represent anything from a weapon, to a rare cosmetic, to a virtual land.\nNFTs have been around for only 3 years but they have already been adopted by some of the most popular video game titles such as CryptoKitties and Decentraland. The potential investment opportunities in NFTs are huge and it is not hard to see why: the gaming industry is worth over $137 billion and its growth rate is at 5% per year which means that it will reach $180 billion by 2020.\nThe Future of Video Games as Decentralized Games on Blockchain Technology Blockchain technology has shown the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry by creating a decentralized ecosystem where players can have ownership of their digital goods and developers are rewarded for their hard work.\nConclusion/Outlook: Cryptoeconomics is changing the world as we know it and with it comes a whole new paradigm of opportunities.\nThis is a new world that\u0026rsquo;s being created. It\u0026rsquo;s a world where we are going to have to think about things in different ways. And it\u0026rsquo;s a world where the old rules don\u0026rsquo;t apply anymore.\nThe future of cryptoeconomics is very bright. It will continue to grow as the world becomes more and more digitalized. As time goes on, it is inevitable that cryptoeconomics will play a larger role in our lives.\nWant to start playing?

Introduction to NFTs - What are they, and how can they be used in games? Non-fungible tokens, also called NFTs, are a type of crypto token that are not fungible. In the world of crypto, a fungible token is something that is exchangeable with any other token of the same type. Whereas an NFT doesn\u0026rsquo;t fit into this category because each replica is unique and cannot be exchanged with others; it has its own set qualities and traits.\nIn this article, we take a look at Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We look at what they are and how they can be used in games.\nThe 5 Most Exciting Uses for NFTs in Gaming Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are becoming very popular within the gaming community because they offer certain benefits which regular cryptocurrencies do not provide. The five most exciting uses for NFTs in gaming are:\n  Trading and Collecting One of the main benefits of NFTs is that they can be traded and collected like traditional collectible items. This means that gamers can buy, sell, or trade their NFTs with other gamers, which can add an extra level of excitement and competition to the gaming experience.\n  Enhancing Gameplay NFTs can also be used to enhance the gameplay of certain games. For example, they can be used to unlock new levels, characters, or items within a game. This can make the gaming experience more immersive and exciting for gamers.\n  Creating Unique Experiences NFTs can also be used to create unique gaming experiences that are not possible with regular cryptocurrencies. For example, they can be used to create virtual worlds or games that are only accessible to those who own a specific NFT. This can add an extra layer of excitement and intrigue to the gaming experience.\n  Supporting Gamers’ Communities NFTs can also be used to support gamers’ communities. For example, they can be used to create virtual worlds where gamers can socialize and collaborate with each other. This can help gamers to build stronger relationships with each other and to have more fun while gaming.\n  Monetizing Games NFTs can also be used to monetize games. This means that gamers can use them to purchase in-game items or features that would otherwise be unavailable to them. This can add an extra level of excitement and intrigue to the gaming experience.\n  NFTs as Reward Systems/Collectibles NFTs can be used in many different ways, with one example being providing rewards for players in a specific game. This reward system is ideal for online gaming because it allows players to retain their digital property for use outside of the game domain and gives game designers the ability to provide exclusive content without having to negotiate with a third party.\nAs well as this, NFTs can be used as collectibles that can be traded with other players or sold on an open market, such as an online auction site.\nNFTs as Game Currency \u0026amp; Store of Value NFTs are unique in that they are digital items. Most of the NFTs in games can be bought and sold with a digital currency called “game coins” or \u0026ldquo;gold\u0026rdquo;. However, some NFTs may be purchased with a different type of digital currency called \u0026ldquo;cryptocurrency\u0026rdquo;.\nNFTs in games play many diverse roles. They represent ownership and identity, allow players to create and customize their gameplay, act as an in-game form of cryptocurrency for buying and selling things online, enable players to earn passive income by renting out their assets for game play, and enable gamers to earn passive income from trading assets.\nNFTs as In-Game Items and Assets NFT is a new technology that enables ownership and tradability of digital assets. NFTs can be used to represent any type of digital asset such as in-game items, virtual goods, crypto collectibles, loyalty points, etc.\nBlock chain-based games are one of the most popular use cases for this new technology. In these types of games, players find themselves in a massive multiplayer game world where they can purchase and trade virtual goods and in-game items with other players to enhance their gaming experience.\nWant to start playing?

The way they work is very similar to how crypto currencies work in general. However, the thing that makes them special is that the value of a NFT token is not dependent on the supply and demand of goods or services. This is because NFTs represent ownership over assets digitized on the blockchain.\nThe worth of an NFT token can vary based on what it represents and its rarity which is determined by its number of units in circulation.

Start out with this section or head over to our blog\nNFT games allow users to own and trade digital assets that are unique and have real-world value. This gives gamers a new level of ownership and control over them in-game items. NFT games are also more secure and transparent than traditional games, which helps to build trust between players and developers. In this article, we will discuss about Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and why they are becoming popular in the gaming industry.\nUnique digital assets Since the advent of the internet, digital assets have been increasing in value and popularity. These days, a wide variety of digital assets are available, including but not limited to cryptocurrency, digital art, and virtual worlds. One of the most unique and exciting types of digital assets are non-fungible tokens, or NFTs. NFTs can be used to represent anything from virtual assets to real-world assets. They are also perfect for use in gaming and other online activities. If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a game-changing digital asset, NFTs are the way to go!\nCannot be replaced by any other asset The value of cryptocurrencies and NFT games cannot be replaced by any other asset. These digital assets offer a new level of security and transparency that is unmatched by any other form of currency. In addition, the decentralized nature of these platforms ensures that players have a level of control and ownership that is not possible with traditional games. As a result, cryptocurrencies and NFT games are quickly becoming the go-to choice for gamers around the world.\nAllows players to earn money There are a growing number of games that allow players to earn money. These games use blockchain technology and cryptocurrency to create a unique gaming experience that allows players to earn real world income. These games are called Non-Fungible Token (NFT) games, and they are quickly gaining in popularity. In these games, players can earn money by completing tasks, defeating opponents, or selling virtual assets. This makes them a great option for gamers who want to make a little extra money. To do this, they simply need to invest in a cryptocurrency wallet and start playing.\nNew and exciting development in the world of gaming There has been some exciting development in the world of gaming with the launch of NFT Games. This is a new platform that allows gamer to use block chain technology to create and trade in-game assets. This offers a whole new level of flexibility and security for gamer, as well as opening up new possibilities for game development. This brought excitement to the gamer since they know that their gaming assets will now have value in the real world and it will be more difficult for developers to seize and control them. On the other hand, developers are also excited with this new development as they can now create games that are more engaging and complex. With NFT Games, the sky is the limit for gaming development.\nConclusion NFT games are becoming increasingly popular as people are looking for new and innovative ways to use their crypto. These games allow users to interact with each other and the game world in ways that weren\u0026rsquo;t possible before. This is due to the use of block chain technology and NFTs. On the other hand, some people are concerned that these games could be used to manipulate the market, but overall, NFT games are proving to be a valuable and fun use of crypto. NFT games are most popular in the crypto community, but they are also starting to gain traction in the general gaming community.\n","date":"18","image":null,"permalink":"/website-hugo-nft-gaming/services/nft-games-101/","tags":null,"title":"Inform yourself"},{"categories":null,"contents":"How much can I earn with Crypto Gaming? This varies widely, depending on several factors we are exploring in another article. But let us look at an example of Axie Infinity, as it is one of the most established games right now. Of course, being an early adopter to a new game might make you a lot of money, but taking Axie as a starting point gives us a good overview of how much an average person might earn. In Axie you are breeding little Axies, which are NFTs, and players earn on average 9-13$ a day (300$/month). There are other possibilities to enhance this amount, with for example being a manager, or simultaneously staking, which results in an average of 66$/day or 2000$ a month.\u0026quot;\nHow much can you earn playing Axie Infinity? What is Axie Infinity? Axie Infinity is a new game where players can breed, battle, and buy creatures called Axies. Think of Pokemon, but with NFTs!\nEach Axie has different settings, and your team will be battling other teams. Additionally two Axies can be bred together to create new Axies, but keep in mind that the more an Axie is breeding, the fewer the offspring and itself will be worth. But if you own two unique Axies and breed them, the result can be a highly valued one that you can sell or add to your team.\nhow much does it cost to get started? To play, you must own 3 Axies, which range in price. Starter Axies are going for ~50 - 100$ as the time of writing, but it is recommended to not choose the cheapest Axies as that is a recipe for failure. You can also start out with 2 Axies and breed them first\nSome players spend a lot of money on in-game items, which translates to money spent on NFTs. I spent about $800 but only for 3 Axies. The price of a team is fairly liquid and you can always re-sell your Axies later, meaning after playing some time you will most likely be able to resell them for quite the same price.\nKeep in mind that you will need the Tokens (AXS and SLP) to breed and play later on as well, so only having the NFTs will not be enough.\nAnd what if I don\u0026rsquo;t have enough money to buy Axies? An interesting change has been the introduction of sponsorships into Axie. In here, players that own a lot of Axies can \u0026ldquo;rent\u0026rdquo; them out to a person looking for so called \u0026ldquo;sponsoring\u0026rdquo;. The sponsored one plays the game, and usually profits are split 70/30 or 50/50. Meaning the so called \u0026ldquo;manager\u0026rdquo; provides people looking for sponsorship with the Axie (investment), and gets 30-50% of the players earnings. This is a good way to get started in the world of Axie.\nhow do you actually make money in Axie Infinity? There are mainly three ways of making money in Axie:\n Breeding Axies and selling the offspring Earning Smooth Love Potion (SLP) through battles with other players and selling it Sponsoring/Managing teams  Let us take a look at each possibility\n1. Breeding Axies and selling the offspring Axies can be bred using the AXS and SLP tokens. The breeding process takes around five days, until the new Axie \u0026ldquo;becomes of age\u0026rdquo; and is playable. After that it can be sold as any NFT via the Axie Marketplace.\nIn general, the \u0026ldquo;rarer\u0026rdquo; the parents, the higher valued the offspring. One has to keep in mind though, that the more Axies breed, the more \u0026ldquo;penalty\u0026rdquo; is applied to the offspring and itself, meaning Axies that were not bread often yet are having a higher value than Axies with a lot of offsprings.\n2. Earning Smooth Love Potion (SLP) to earn money As SLP and AXS are required for breeding Axies, SLP becomes a rare commodity for players, and therefore people are willing to buy it. SLP can be earned whilst playing the game, for example whilst completing quests or battling other players. As SLP is \u0026ldquo;just\u0026rdquo; a token like ETH and others, it can easily be traded on several platforms for \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; money like Euro or Dollar.\n3. Sponsoring or Managing Axie teams As stated above \u0026ldquo;Managers\u0026rdquo; can hire \u0026ldquo;Sponsors\u0026rdquo; to play with their Axies for them, splitting the earnings along the way. If you are planning to just invest in Axies, you can buy a lot of them and then hire sponsors to play for you.\nOn the other hand, if you do not want to invest much into Axies, you can become a sponsored player and get some Axies provided by the Manager, and start playing. This is especially good if you just want to \u0026ldquo;try it out\u0026rdquo; without risking much cash.\nUsually the splits range between 70/30 (70% for the manager, 30% for the player), and 50/50.\nOne does not have to do much math to see that the manager is making himself quite a good deal here. Whilst being sponsored is a good way to try it out, keep in mind that it is highly competitive and earnings are not that high.\nI would recommend buying some cheap starter Axies as they are quite stable in price, and can be sold later on as well. This is no investment advice though, and of course as everything in Crypto all your money can be lost in minutes. Be careful and never invest more than you can loose.\nnow, how much can i earn playing Axie? Now that we had a look at the basics, let us talk numbers!\nRight now, as of March 2022, basically nothing! Surprised? I just took Axie as an example, and most likely you should be on the lookout for other games. But Axie is bringing out big new features as well, so the price might drive up in the future. Also, the cryptomarket is quite low as of now, but might surely be \u0026ldquo;back to normal\u0026rdquo; soon. Therefore, to calculate earnings, I will take the prices as of ~October/November 2021, where prices where quite realistic.\nBuying a team back then would have set you back around 800 USD.\nhow much do i earn just playing the game? Just playing the game an average player would make 9-13$ a day (~300$/month). This would be when playing for around 3-4 hours a day, but with a better Axie combination, an experienced player and 10 dedicated hours a day earnings can go up to 60$ a day. Now, for some people this might not sound like much, but keep in mind that most people are betting on AXS and SLP prices to shoot upwards in the future, and you are earning it whilst playing a game on your couch!\nGetting your investment back this way would take you 800$/300$=2.7 months, which is not a bad return of investment (not counting the time spent playing).\nhow much do i earn breeding Axies? Additionally, if you are earning money people usually reinvest it into better Axies, keep breeding them and sell the unique offspring. The most expensive Axie ever sold went for 300 ETH, or 1.1 million USD source.\nhow much do I earn as an Axie manager? The next possibility would be to become a manager, and \u0026ldquo;rent out\u0026rdquo; your Axies to sponsored people. As described above, earnings of your sponsored player will be split anywhere between 70/30 (70% for you) and 50/50. Usually the split is at 60/40, which can provide you quite a nice passive income.\nLet us take a look at the 800$ investment from above:\nAs a good player your sponsored Axie gamer will make around 20$ a day. Earnings are split 60/40, which leaves you with 12$ and him with 8$ for his work.\nCalculating the number of days until breaking even (ROI), this turns out to be 800$/12$ = 67 days. Not bad if you compare that to the usual ROIs of other financial products.\nIf you are continuing that calculation without reinvestments this would result in a ROI of 547.5%, or a plus of 4.380,-$!\nNow let us say you are planning to invest 100,000 USD as a manager. With 1k$ a team this would leave you with 100 teams, each earning you around 12$ a day, totaling to 1,200 USD a day or 36,000 USD a month!\nToo good to be true? Keep in mind that the NFTs, AXS and SLP tokens can be really volatile. Meaning if the worth of Axie is crashing (like it did now), you might loose your 100,000$ investment immediately. DeFi and Crypto stays a high risk investment, even if Axie has been relatively stable in the past.\nAnd again, this is not investment advice, but rather just an informational website. Calculate your own risk or contact an investment professional before investing in crypto, or at least distribute your investments over several crypto games.\n","date":"13","image":null,"permalink":"/website-hugo-nft-gaming/services/how-much-can-i-earn/","tags":null,"title":"How much can I earn with NFT gaming?"},{"categories":null,"contents":"what do I need to get started with crypto games? If you already own crypto the process is quite straight-forward. If not, you would first need to trade your local currency to crypto, and then buy NFTs of that game on a matching marketplace. As I found the process quite confusing, I have decided to add a little step-by-step guide on a real world example that you know from our previous tutorials: Axie Infinity!\nTo be more technical, the team of Axie Infinity has created an own network called \u0026ldquo;Ronin\u0026rdquo;, which is basically a sidechain of Ethereum, but with lower Gas fees. It was created because the current gas prices (transaction fees) of Ethereum became quite high, and one transaction costing 20$ is not at all sustainable for gaming! The Ronin network of Axie\u0026rsquo;s team is way cheaper and allows for cheap transactions.\nTherefore you will need to \u0026ldquo;transfer\u0026rdquo; your Ethereum to the Ronin network, for which you will get wETH, which is a token representing your ETH on the Ronin network. Think of it as your ETH being \u0026ldquo;parked\u0026rdquo; on the Ethereum mainnet, and of wETH as the key to get it back. But keep in mind, if you loose your wETH your ETH on the mainnet is lost as well!\nSo if you already own wETH or ETH skip the next section, but if you do not own any crypto yet let us buy some!\n(optional) buy yourself some crypto! As Axie Infinity is running on the Ethereum (ETH) platform, you will require (w)Ethereum to buy Axies. To get Ethereum, you will need to go to a platform that converts your local currency (FIAT) to Crypto. The bad news is, that this requires a lot of verification. The good news is: Register now, and during the time it takes to get activated have a look around the Crypto Gaming scene, try some stuff out already and think about your ideal setup!\nSo, what are the best platforms to buy crypto? This could be an article on its own, but let me break it down to these two:\n Binance Coinbase  How did I end up choosing these? They are the biggest exchanges to date, and even though smaller exchanges might offer better rates, they are also more vulnerable, whilst these two have a track record of years, and already resisted a lot of hacking attempts. Now one could argue that if they are bigger, more hackers will try to attack them - which is true - but it also shows that they are investing a lot into security, as this would be their death. Additionally, at least in my opinion, the chance that they \u0026ldquo;run off\u0026rdquo; with all that money is slim, as they are actually earning more in the long run compared to a short-time shady scheme.\nstep by step instructions to open an Account I will provide an example of Binance, but the steps for coinbase are basically the same.\n Head over to Binance Click on \u0026ldquo;register\u0026rdquo; You will then be asked to verify your Email, Phone and ID This process can take some time, but once you are done you should see the following screen:  Buying Crypto with Fiat Currency in your account Next, click on Buy Crypto/Deposit, which should take you to this screen:\nAs you can see, several options are offered, which I will describe in a little more detail:\n1. Bank Card (Visa/MC)\n Instant, which is cool, but a 1.8% fee 1.8% can be a lot, I would not recommend it except you really want to start  2. Bank Transfer (SEPA) - (recommended if you have time)\n 0% fee, but takes 2-3 business days Probably the most \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; way to transact money from your account  3. Advcash (Instant SEPA) - (recommended if you do not have time)\n 1€ fee, instant if your bank supports instant sepa (google \u0026lsquo;YOURBANK instant sepa\u0026rsquo;) Good solution for instant payments, but keep in mind that you need to register and verify on Advcash as well, and Advcash has payment limits (10k/month, 1k a day)  4. P2P Express (not recommended)\n Leave this out if this is your first crypto purchase It has basically zero fees, and it usually offers the cheapest conversion rate, but it is Person to Person, offering a lot of possibility for complications, scam and tax authority problems You are basically sending your money to a stranger who then pays you crypto  Converting your FIAT currency to Axie\u0026rsquo;s currency (WETH) The good thing about binance is, that we can skip the step of buying ETH itself. This is good, as ETH\u0026rsquo;s transactions are quite expensive, and we can directly convert to wETH and send it to the Ronin network.\nThe fastest and easiest way to convert is to use the \u0026ldquo;default\u0026rdquo; Binance convert link, but if you are willing to tinker a bit you might get a better price on the classic trade screen.\nPayday Loan Application Processing  Interest may vary, be fixed, or mixed, will on the lender\u0026rsquo;s and characteristics Depending on the granting institution and the amount of the loan, goods The loan can be granted to anyone, as long as they make the loan application   What You Know About Loans    What Services We Render Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
