# what do I need to get started with crypto games?

What if I tell you there are games in which you can "mine" coins like Tilium (TLM), which then can be traded to your local currency? Too good to be true? Not really, just the future called "play-to-earn"!

If you already own crypto the process is quite straight-forward. If not, you would first need to trade your local currency to crypto, and then buy NFTs of that game on a matching marketplace. As I found the process quite confusing, I have decided to add a little step-by-step guide on a real world example that you know from our previous tutorials: Decentraland!

The thing with Cryptogames is, that transactions on the Ethereum or Bitcoin network become real expensive real quick. For example one transaction on the Ethereum network can easily cost 20$, which would not be usable for crypto games where basically every action is a transaction. Therefore many game developers are creating their own so called "side-chains", that are based on the Ethereum network, but run independently. Because they are sacrificing some security, transactions become computationally cheaper, and therefore cheaper in terms of transaction fees. The main goal here is to find the right balance between security and usability. Long story short: You will need to transfer some of your crypto to these sidechains in order to play the game. Keep in mind though that these chains are not as secure as the Ethereum network, and big amounts of crypto should not be stored here.

In terms of Decentraland, the so called ["Metamask"](https://metamask.io/) wallet on the WAX blockchain is used. The native token here is MANA, which can be bought at [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355), Moonpay or many other platforms. 
In order to play the game a Metamask wallet is required, which will act as your unique "account" and login to the platform. The minimum amount to create a Metamask wallet is 5 MANA. The game can be tough on the free-to-play basis, so I would recommend buying three starter items which cost ~60$ at the time of writing. More on that further down below, but if you are unsure start with the 5 MANA first, otherwise aim for around 100$ to start with.
Whilst Moonpay allows direct payment from the credit card, it is also quite expensive, for which I would recommend buying MANA on [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) and then transferring it to the Metamask wallet. 


So if you already own wETH or ETH skip the next section, but if you do not own any crypto yet let us buy some!

## (optional) buy yourself some crypto!

As Decentraland is running on the WAX platform, you will require MANA to buy assets. To get MANA, you will need to go to a platform that converts your local currency (FIAT) to Crypto. The bad news is, that this requires a lot of verification. The good news is: Register now, and during the time it takes to get activated have a look around the Crypto Gaming scene, try some stuff out already and think about your ideal setup!

So, what are the best platforms to buy crypto? This could be an article on its own, but let me break it down to these two:

1. [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355)
2. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/guese_z) - Coinbase will give you 9€ in free Bitcoin if you buy 90€+ in Crypto using this link

How did I end up choosing these? They are the biggest exchanges to date, and even though smaller exchanges might offer better rates, they are also more vulnerable, whilst these two have a track record of years, and already resisted a lot of hacking attempts. Now one could argue that if they are bigger, more hackers will try to attack them - which is true - but it also shows that they are investing a lot into security, as this would be their death. Additionally, at least in my opinion, the chance that they "run off" with all that money is slim, as they are actually earning more in the long run compared to a short-time shady scheme.

### step by step instructions to open an Account

I will provide an example of Binance, but the steps for coinbase are basically the same.

![Binance Registration](images/binance-registration-1.png)

1. Head over to [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355)
2. Click on "register"
3. You will then be asked to verify your Email, Phone and ID
4. This process can take some time, but once you are done you should see the following screen:

![Binance Final Registration Screen](images/binance-registration-2.png)

### Buying Crypto with Fiat Currency in your account

Next, click on [Buy Crypto](https://www.binance.com/en/fiat/deposit/EUR?ref=37092355)/Deposit, which should take you to this screen:

![Binance Deposit Screen](images/binance-purchase.png)

As you can see, several options are offered, which I will describe in a little more detail:

**1. Bank Card (Visa/MC)**

- Instant, which is cool, but a 1.8% fee
- 1.8% can be a lot, I would not recommend it except you really want to start

**2. Bank Transfer (SEPA) - (recommended if you have time)**

- 0% fee, but takes 2-3 business days
- Probably the most "normal" way to transact money from your account

**3. Advcash (Instant SEPA) - (recommended if you do not have time)**

- 1€ fee, instant if your bank supports instant sepa (google 'YOURBANK instant sepa')
- Good solution for instant payments, but keep in mind that you need to register and verify on Advcash as well, and Advcash has payment limits (10k/month, 1k a day)

**4. P2P Express (not recommended)**

- Leave this out if this is your first crypto purchase
- It has basically zero fees, and it usually offers the cheapest conversion rate, but it is Person to Person, offering a lot of possibility for complications, scam and tax authority problems
- You are basically sending your money to a stranger who then pays you crypto 

## Converting your FIAT currency to Axie's currency (MANA)

The fastest and easiest way to convert is to use the "default" Binance [convert link](https://www.binance.com/en/convert?ref=37092355), but if you are willing to tinker a bit you might get a better price on the [classic trade screen](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?ref=37092355).

In the first field select your FIAT currency, so Euro, Dollar or whatever you are using. 
In the second field type in "MANA", and type in the Euro amount of MANA you want to buy. If the conversion looks good to you (Binance is usually the best), click on convert.

Next, head over to "wallet", and have a look at your current balance in MANA (and the remaining FIAT if you did not spend everything).

## Creating a Metamask wallet

Head over to [https://metamask.io/download/](https://metamask.io/download/) and create a new wallet/account. 

## Transferring the MANA from Binance to the Metamask Wallet

Heading back to your Binance "wallet" screen, click on "withdraw" on the row where it says MANA.

![Binance withdraw screen](images/binance-withdraw.png)

You will then be asked to insert the "new user" id and your unique code in the two fields, together with the amount of MANA you wish to transfer.

![MANA withdrawal](images/binance-MANA-withdraw.png)

**Make sure you surely typed in your credentials, as a mistake would mean you are not getting your money back!**

Next, head over to your Metamask wallet and wait for the MANA to arrive.

# How to start out in Decentraland (Guide)


Decentraland is a decentralized virtual environment where you may purchase, sell, and build non-fungible currencies, as well as digital real estate and artwork (NFTs). All of this may be accomplished by playing games and participating in various activities in the virtual world!
You don't need much to play in Decentraland; as a guest user, you can just explore the planet by visiting its website in a browser. Then create an avatar, give it a name, verify your legal age, agree to the terms and conditions, and you're set to go!

However, mobile devices are not yet supported by the platform.
To fully enjoy all of the benefits of Decentraland, you should also have a crypto wallet to safely store your cryptocurrencies and other digital assets. You'll only be able to browse around and create your avatar if you don't have a wallet; you won't be able to participate in activities.
You can create 3D environments and avatars, as well as display a variety of digital items that can be sold on Decentraland—the possibilities are endless! Once you're in the virtual environment, you can go wherever you like or use the map to teleport to a specific spot.
All from the comfort of your own home, go to a virtual club, see NFT art displays, compete in a racing game, or catch up with virtual mates. All of this will be done as avatars or digital representations of yourself. Your avatar assists people in recognizing you and assists you in keeping track of all of your friends.
You may now change the appearance of your avatar in a variety of ways to make it as individual as you are. Choose from a wide range of face traits, such as eyes, smiles, and facial hair, as well as the perfect outfit, skin tone, and hairstyles. You may also give your avatar a unique name to make it more personal. After you've designed your ideal avatar, you can go exploring in the virtual world.

## Obtaining a DecentraLand Avatar as well as Passport

Avatars allow Decentraland users to design their own unique look, which can be customized in hundreds of ways, and then be given a Passport that allows them to launch on infinite travels in the Metaverse.
Users can then claim a one-of-a-kind name on the blockchain. Your Decentraland identity facilitates communication between friend sized outsiders. Every name is unique because it cannot be replicated by another user, so make sure you obtain yours before someone else does.
The first 4,000 users to claim a name will receive a limited-edition blockchain wearable from MyCryptoHeroes, a popular Ethereum blockchain-based war game. These can be traded in Decentraland's open marketplaces.
Claim a name normally costs 100 MANA, but for the first 1,000 people who use the cryptocurrency wallet Trust Wallet, it's entirely free. Furthermore, the gas fee will be covered by Trust Wallet and its exchange partner Binance.
Simply go to avatars.decentraland.org, make an account, and personalize your Avatar. You can choose from a wide range of body, face, haircut, and wardrobe options to create your own unique look. Make a statement with blue hair or blend in with a beige pullover. Your Avatar can look similar to you or completely different from you. It's entirely up to you!

![Decentraland Character creation ](images/games/decentraland-char.jpg)
 
The introduction of avatars not only allows users to express themselves and be identified in Decentraland, but it also opens up new potential for marketers and content creators. They'll be able to develop and issue Avatar wearables for sale in the marketplace, for starters. Users will be able to resell these wearables to other users to generate money. Wearables and virtual goods, on the other hand, are only the beginning of what promises to be an intriguing and ever-changing aspect of Decentraland.
Check out the Decentraland Avatars hub right now and make your own while you're at it. Make haste before someone else steals your look!

## Creating Decentraland Wearables

The objects that your Decentraland Avatar wears while in the World Explorer are known as Decentraland Wearables. Wearables are currently available for an avatar's feet, lower body, upper body, face, and head. In Decentraland, users can customize their avatars with wearables.
Clothing, accessories, and bodily features are all examples of wearables. Users can design garments and wearables and earn from them by selling them on the secondary market. You'll need 3D modeling knowledge for this, but you can always hire other designers to help.
Decentraland Wearables are divided into five rarity levels. According to the smart contract for each collection, the rarity categories correspond to the maximum number of tokenized wearables that can be minted for each design (more on collections later).
In the Decentraland Marketplace and the Explorer's Avatar Editor mode, each rarity has a corresponding backdrop color. The following table outlines the many kinds of wearable rarity:

!["Decentraland Rarity table 1"](images/games/decentraland-table1.png)	 
!["Decentraland Rarity table 2"](images/games/decentraland-table2.png)	


## Publishing your Decentraland Wearables

Go to [https://builder.decentraland.org](https://builder.decentraland.org) to start uploading and publishing your wearables.
To log in using your Metamask wallet, click Sign in and then Connect. Select the Collections tab after logging in. To begin, click New Item or New Collection if you haven't done so already. If you've already uploaded some wearables, you may edit them by selecting the item or collection and then clicking Edit, or you can add new ones by selecting the Plus icon next to the Open Editor button.
When creating a collection, start by giving it a name and then clicking Create. You can start adding items to your collection after you've created it.

![Decentraland collection](images/games/decentraland-new-collection.png)
 
Your collection's name cannot be changed after it has been published!
You can add as many items as you want till your collection is published. Always remember that you can't affect the rarity of things in published collections by adding, removing, or changing their rarity.

Select the collection, click New Item, and then select your wearable files to add to your new collection. 

![Decentraland collection - new item](images/games/decentraland-new-item.png)

Also, you can create your items first and then drag and drop to your collection!

![Decentraland item overview](images/games/decentraland-item-overview.png)

## How to Attribute Collaborators

If you worked on your items with other artists, you can provide attributions in the Wearables Editor. This is only possible after a collection has been published.
To begin, go to the Builder and click on the Collections Tab. Pick the collection containing the items you want to attribute, then select Collaborators from the icon next to the Mint Items button.
Simply enter their Ethereum address and click Add to add colleagues. You can collaborate with as many people as you wish. Simply click Remove next to the collaborator's address to remove them.

## How to Sell Your Wearables

Your products can be sold to other users in the metaverse after they've been published in a collection and authorized by the Curation Committee.
Primary and secondary sales are both options for selling something.

- The Decentraland Store's smart contract handles primary sales. The item is automatically minted during a primary sale, and it is sold for the price you set in the Wearable Editor.
- The Decentraland Marketplace's smart contract handles secondary sales. When a user sells an item in the Marketplace after it has been minted or purchased in a primary sale, this is known as a secondary sale. In a secondary sale, items can be sold for any amount.

Go to the [Decentraland store](https://decentraland.org/) to see what's offered in the primary sale. 
Visit the [Decentraland Marketplace](https://market.decentraland.org/) to see what's available for secondary sale.

### Primary sales

When someone buys one of your products for the first time, you have a primary sale. Only the Decentraland Store's smart contract can make these sales.
When a user purchases one of your things for the first time, the store mints the item, transfers it to the buyer, and sends the MANA revenues to the beneficiary address.
Remember! To sell your products in primary sales, you don't need to mint them!
Begin by going to the Builder and selecting the Collections option to sell your products through primary sales.

### Setting price and beneficiary address

Set the price and beneficiary for each item in the collection you'd like to sell. The beneficiary address is the address to which the MANA from a primary sale will be sent.
If you set the primary sale price to "Free," consumers will be able to buy your things for free in the shop, but they will be able to resale them at any price in a secondary sale later.
Any item in your collection can have its price and beneficiary address changed at any time.

### Activate primary sales.

Finally, in the confirmation window that displays, click the On Sale switch and then Turn On. Your collection will be available for purchase in the Decentraland store once this switch is enabled.
 
When a user makes a primary purchase, the Decentraland store will mint one of your things automatically as long as this switch is switched on.
This implies you can mint and sell all of your available things until you reach the maximum supply. You must manually mint an item to one of your personal wallet addresses if you want to save one or more of your products before advertising them for sale.
Anyone who buys one of your things can resell it in Decentraland's Marketplace at any moment for any price in a secondary sale.
A 2.5 percent fee is applied to all primary sales in the Decentraland in-world store. This charge is forwarded to the DAO.

### Secondary sales

Items can be sold in secondary sales in the Decentraland Marketplace at any time and for any price after:

- They've either been coined or
- They were purchased in a primary auction

To put it another way, anyone has an NFT for a wearable can sell it on the Decentraland Marketplace. In Decentraland, there are no royalties on wearables sold in secondary markets.

## How to Buy Decentraland Wearables

The Decentraland Marketplace and Opensea.io are the two main marketplaces where Decentraland users can buy and trade wearables.
We'll go through how to buy and sell Decentraland wearables on the Decentraland Marketplace in this guide.
Wearables' main URL is [https://market.decentraland.org/browse?
page=1§ion=wearables&sortBy=recently listed&onlyOnSale=true](https://market.decentraland.org/browse?
page=1§ion=wearables&sortBy=recently listed&onlyOnSale=true)
Fees: In MANA, the seller pays 2.5 percent of the sale price. The remainder is "burned" (transferred to a wallet that takes the MANA out of circulation permanently). There are no fees for the buyer.
Pros:

- Individual wearables have lower fees.
- It's simple to use.

Cons:
- There will be no bundling of items.
- There is no possibility of a private sale.
- It is not possible to see the number of units produced.

## Buying Wearables On the Decentraland Marketplace
 
![Buying wearables on decentraland marketplace](images/games/decentraland-buying-wearables.png)

We will purchase a Decentraland Launch T-Shirt (one of Decentraland's most popular goods) to demonstrate the functionality of the Decentraland Marketplace. By clicking the link above, we'll be sent to the "Browse" page (see above). The marketplace, as you can see, offers a lot of features, including the following:
Allows you to sort wearables by the part of the avatar's body they correspond to.
Filter: Enables you to use extra search and sorting features.
When this option is selected, only items that are on sale are displayed. When this option is disabled, all objects that match the search parameters are displayed.
Rarity: Sorts objects based on their rarity.
Gender: Sort items by the gender for whom the wearable is appropriate. Many goods are unisex and can be worn by both men and women, but others are gender specific.
Allows you to sort by a specific wearable collection.
Sort by Cheapest, Recently Listed, Newest (recently minted), and Name in the Sort Dropdown.
Now that we've seen what's available, we'll look for the Launch T-Shirt by activating the menu bar with the "Filter" button and typing "Decentraland Launch T-Shirt" into the "Search" bar. To view the cheapest things first, we sort by "Cheapest." The costs for each item are shown in MANA beneath the photos.
 
![Decentraland buying photos](images/games/decentraland-buying-tshirts.png)

Then we click on the cheapest shirt, which costs 444 MANA. This takes you to a new page. More information about the Decentraland Launch T-Shirt can be found on that page. It tells us, for example, that the item is of the Swanky rarity, that it is unisex, and that it is worn on the avatar's upper body (it can be worn by either gender avatar). The page also provides details about the individual job ad. The price of the wearable and the posting's expiration date, for example, are indicated. A link to the Ethereum wallet of the wearable's owner is also presented.
Finally, we can choose whether to "Buy" or "Bid" on the item. When you buy something, you're getting it for the price it's posted for. Bidding on an item generates an offer for the item, which the owner can accept or reject. In the "My Bids" section, you may see and amend your bids, as well as see bids on your items.

![Decentraland item buying](images/games/decentraland-buying-wearables-result.png)
 
Now we will purchase the Launch T-Shirt for the price displayed, 444 MANA. To do so, we click the “BUY” button. That brings up the following screen:

![Decentraland item buying confirmation](images/games/decentraland-buy-confirmation.png)

After that, we click BUY and are asked to confirm the transaction using our wallet. I'm using the Metamask Wallet in this example.
 
![Decentraland item buying - metamask](images/games/decentraland-wearables-metamask.png)

![Decentraland item buying - customizing gas](images/games/decentraland-buying-wearables-customizing-gas.png)

You will be directed to an activity screen after confirming the transaction, which will state that you have purchased the item but that the transaction is still pending.
 
![Decentraland pending item](images/games/decentraland-buying-wearables-pending.png)

You'll get a message in your wallet and the activity screen will change to "Confirmed" once the transaction is confirmed.

CONGRATULATIONS! In the Explorer, you can now wear your recently acquired Launch T-Shirt!
