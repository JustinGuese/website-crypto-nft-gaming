## How much can I earn with Crypto Gaming?

This varies widely, depending on several factors we are exploring in another article. But let us look at an example of Axie Infinity, as it is one of the most established games right now. Of course, being an early adopter to a new game might make you a lot of money, but taking Axie as a starting point gives us a good overview of how much an average person might earn. In Axie you are breeding little Axies, which are NFTs, and players earn on average 9-13$ a day (300$/month). 
There are other possibilities to enhance this amount, with for example being a manager, or simultaneously staking, which results in an average of 66$/day or 2000$ a month."

## How much can you earn playing Axie Infinity?

### What is Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity is a new game where players can breed, battle, and buy creatures called Axies. Think of Pokemon, but with NFTs!

Each Axie has different settings, and your team will be battling other teams. Additionally two Axies can be bred together to create new Axies, but keep in mind that the more an Axie is breeding, the fewer the offspring and itself will be worth. But if you own two unique Axies and breed them, the result can be a highly valued one that you can sell or add to your team. 

### how much does it cost to get started?

To play, you must own 3 Axies, which range in price. Starter Axies are going for ~50 - 100$ as the time of writing, but it is recommended to not choose the cheapest Axies as that is a recipe for failure. You can also start out with 2 Axies and breed them first

Some players spend a lot of money on in-game items, which translates to money spent on NFTs. I spent about $800 but only for 3 Axies. The price of a team is fairly liquid and you can always re-sell your Axies later, meaning after playing some time you will most likely be able to resell them for quite the same price.

Keep in mind that you will need the Tokens (AXS and SLP) to breed and play later on as well, so only having the NFTs will not be enough.

#### And what if I don't have enough money to buy Axies?

An interesting change has been the introduction of sponsorships into Axie. In here, players that own a lot of Axies can "rent" them out to a person looking for so called "sponsoring". The sponsored one plays the game, and usually profits are split 70/30 or 50/50. Meaning the so called "manager" provides people looking for sponsorship with the Axie (investment), and gets 30-50% of the players earnings. This is a good way to get started in the world of Axie. 

### how do you actually make money in Axie Infinity?

There are mainly three ways of making money in Axie:

1. Breeding Axies and selling the offspring
2. Earning Smooth Love Potion (SLP) through battles with other players and selling it
3. Sponsoring/Managing teams

Let us take a look at each possibility

#### 1. Breeding Axies and selling the offspring

Axies can be bred using the AXS and SLP tokens. The breeding process takes around five days, until the new Axie "becomes of age" and is playable. After that it can be sold as any NFT via the [Axie Marketplace](https://marketplace.axieinfinity.com/).

In general, the "rarer" the parents, the higher valued the offspring. One has to keep in mind though, that the more Axies breed, the more "penalty" is applied to the offspring and itself, meaning Axies that were not bread often yet are having a higher value than Axies with a lot of offsprings. 

#### 2. Earning Smooth Love Potion (SLP) to earn money

As SLP and AXS are required for breeding Axies, SLP becomes a rare commodity for players, and therefore people are willing to buy it.
SLP can be earned whilst playing the game, for example whilst completing quests or battling other players. As SLP is "just" a token like ETH and others, it can easily be traded on several platforms for "real" money like Euro or Dollar.

#### 3. Sponsoring or Managing Axie teams

As stated above "Managers" can hire "Sponsors" to play with their Axies for them, splitting the earnings along the way. If you are planning to just invest in Axies, you can buy a lot of them and then hire sponsors to play for you.

On the other hand, if you do not want to invest much into Axies, you can become a sponsored player and get some Axies provided by the Manager, and start playing. This is especially good if you just want to "try it out" without risking much cash. 

Usually the splits range between 70/30 (70% for the manager, 30% for the player), and 50/50.

One does not have to do much math to see that the manager is making himself quite a good deal here. Whilst being sponsored is a good way to try it out, keep in mind that it is highly competitive and earnings are not that high.

I would recommend buying some cheap starter Axies as they are quite stable in price, and can be sold later on as well. This is no investment advice though, and of course as everything in Crypto all your money can be lost in minutes. Be careful and never invest more than you can loose.

## now, how much can i earn playing Axie?

Now that we had a look at the basics, let us talk numbers!

Right now, as of March 2022, basically nothing! Surprised? I just took Axie as an example, and most likely you should be on the lookout for other games. But Axie is bringing out big new features as well, so the price might drive up in the future.
Also, the cryptomarket is quite low as of now, but might surely be "back to normal" soon. Therefore, to calculate earnings, I will take the prices as of ~October/November 2021, where prices where quite realistic. 

Buying a team back then would have set you back around 800 USD.

### how much do i earn just playing the game?

Just playing the game an average player would make 9-13$ a day (~300$/month).
This would be when playing for around 3-4 hours a day, but with a better Axie combination, an experienced player and 10 dedicated hours a day earnings can go up to 60$ a day. Now, for some people this might not sound like much, but keep in mind that most people are betting on AXS and SLP prices to shoot upwards in the future, and you are earning it whilst playing a game on your couch!

Getting your investment back this way would take you 800$/300$=2.7 months, which is not a bad return of investment (not counting the time spent playing).

### how much do i earn breeding Axies?

Additionally, if you are earning money people usually reinvest it into better Axies, keep breeding them and sell the unique offspring. The most expensive Axie ever sold went for 300 ETH, or 1.1 million USD [source](https://www.esports.net/news/crypto-gaming/most-expensive-gaming-nft/).

### how much do I earn as an Axie manager?

The next possibility would be to become a manager, and "rent out" your Axies to sponsored people. As described above, earnings of your sponsored player will be split anywhere between 70/30 (70% for you) and 50/50. Usually the split is at 60/40, which can provide you quite a nice passive income.

Let us take a look at the 800$ investment from above:

As a good player your sponsored Axie gamer will make around 20$ a day. Earnings are split 60/40, which leaves you with 12$ and him with 8$ for his work.

Calculating the number of days until breaking even (ROI), this turns out to be 800$/12$ = 67 days. Not bad if you compare that to the usual ROIs of other financial products.

If you are continuing that calculation without reinvestments this would result in a ROI of **547.5%**, or a plus of 4.380,-$!

Now let us say you are planning to invest 100,000 USD as a manager. With 1k$ a team this would leave you with 100 teams, each earning you around 12$ a day, totaling to 1,200 USD a day or 36,000 USD a month!

Too good to be true? Keep in mind that the NFTs, AXS and SLP tokens can be really volatile. Meaning if the worth of Axie is crashing (like it did now), you might loose your 100,000$ investment immediately. DeFi and Crypto stays a high risk investment, even if Axie has been relatively stable in the past. 

And again, this is not investment advice, but rather just an informational website. Calculate your own risk or contact an investment professional before investing in crypto, or at least distribute your investments over several crypto games.
