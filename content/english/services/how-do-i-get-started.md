# what do I need to get started with crypto games?

What if I tell you there are games in which you can "mine" coins like Tilium (TLM), which then can be traded to your local currency? Too good to be true? Not really, just the future called "play-to-earn"!

If you already own crypto the process is quite straight-forward. If not, you would first need to trade your local currency to crypto, and then buy NFTs of that game on a matching marketplace. As I found the process quite confusing, I have decided to add a little step-by-step guide on a real world example that you know from our previous tutorials: Alienworlds!

The thing with Cryptogames is, that transactions on the Ethereum or Bitcoin network become real expensive real quick. For example one transaction on the Ethereum network can easily cost 20$, which would not be usable for crypto games where basically every action is a transaction. Therefore many game developers are creating their own so called "side-chains", that are based on the Ethereum network, but run independently. Because they are sacrificing some security, transactions become computationally cheaper, and therefore cheaper in terms of transaction fees. The main goal here is to find the right balance between security and usability. Long story short: You will need to transfer some of your crypto to these sidechains in order to play the game. Keep in mind though that these chains are not as secure as the Ethereum network, and big amounts of crypto should not be stored here.

In terms of Alienworlds, the so called ["WAX"](https://on.wax.io/wax-io/) wallet on the WAX blockchain is used. The native token here is WAXP, which can be bought at [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355), Moonpay or many other platforms. 
In order to play the game a WAX wallet is required, which will act as your unique "account" and login to the platform. The minimum amount to create a WAX wallet is 5 WAXP. The game can be tough on the free-to-play basis, so I would recommend buying three starter items which cost ~60$ at the time of writing. More on that further down below, but if you are unsure start with the 5 WAXP first, otherwise aim for around 100$ to start with.
Whilst Moonpay allows direct payment from the credit card, it is also quite expensive, for which I would recommend buying WAXP on [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) and then transferring it to the WAX wallet. 


So if you already own wETH or ETH skip the next section, but if you do not own any crypto yet let us buy some!

## (optional) buy yourself some crypto!

As Alienworlds is running on the WAX platform, you will require WAXP to buy assets. To get WAXP, you will need to go to a platform that converts your local currency (FIAT) to Crypto. The bad news is, that this requires a lot of verification. The good news is: Register now, and during the time it takes to get activated have a look around the Crypto Gaming scene, try some stuff out already and think about your ideal setup!

So, what are the best platforms to buy crypto? This could be an article on its own, but let me break it down to these two:

1. [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355)
2. [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/join/guese_z) - Coinbase will give you 9€ in free Bitcoin if you buy 90€+ in Crypto using this link

How did I end up choosing these? They are the biggest exchanges to date, and even though smaller exchanges might offer better rates, they are also more vulnerable, whilst these two have a track record of years, and already resisted a lot of hacking attempts. Now one could argue that if they are bigger, more hackers will try to attack them - which is true - but it also shows that they are investing a lot into security, as this would be their death. Additionally, at least in my opinion, the chance that they "run off" with all that money is slim, as they are actually earning more in the long run compared to a short-time shady scheme.

### step by step instructions to open an Account

I will provide an example of Binance, but the steps for coinbase are basically the same.

![Binance Registration](images/binance-registration-1.png)

1. Head over to [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355)
2. Click on "register"
3. You will then be asked to verify your Email, Phone and ID
4. This process can take some time, but once you are done you should see the following screen:

![Binance Final Registration Screen](images/binance-registration-2.png)

### Buying Crypto with Fiat Currency in your account

Next, click on [Buy Crypto](https://www.binance.com/en/fiat/deposit/EUR?ref=37092355)/Deposit, which should take you to this screen:

![Binance Deposit Screen](images/binance-purchase.png)

As you can see, several options are offered, which I will describe in a little more detail:

**1. Bank Card (Visa/MC)**

- Instant, which is cool, but a 1.8% fee
- 1.8% can be a lot, I would not recommend it except you really want to start

**2. Bank Transfer (SEPA) - (recommended if you have time)**

- 0% fee, but takes 2-3 business days
- Probably the most "normal" way to transact money from your account

**3. Advcash (Instant SEPA) - (recommended if you do not have time)**

- 1€ fee, instant if your bank supports instant sepa (google 'YOURBANK instant sepa')
- Good solution for instant payments, but keep in mind that you need to register and verify on Advcash as well, and Advcash has payment limits (10k/month, 1k a day)

**4. P2P Express (not recommended)**

- Leave this out if this is your first crypto purchase
- It has basically zero fees, and it usually offers the cheapest conversion rate, but it is Person to Person, offering a lot of possibility for complications, scam and tax authority problems
- You are basically sending your money to a stranger who then pays you crypto 

## Converting your FIAT currency to Axie's currency (WAXP)

The fastest and easiest way to convert is to use the "default" Binance [convert link](https://www.binance.com/en/convert?ref=37092355), but if you are willing to tinker a bit you might get a better price on the [classic trade screen](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?ref=37092355).

In the first field select your FIAT currency, so Euro, Dollar or whatever you are using. 
In the second field type in "WAXP", and type in the Euro amount of WAXP you want to buy. If the conversion looks good to you (Binance is usually the best), click on convert.

Next, head over to "wallet", and have a look at your current balance in WAXP (and the remaining FIAT if you did not spend everything).

## Creating a WAX wallet

Head over to [https://wallet.wax.io/](https://wallet.wax.io/) and create a new wallet/account. It will create a temporary "newuser" wallet name and a unique code such that they know the transaction is coming from you.

## Transferring the WAXP from Binance to WAX

Heading back to your Binance "wallet" screen, click on "withdraw" on the row where it says WAXP.

![Binance withdraw screen](images/binance-withdraw.png)

You will then be asked to insert the "new user" id and your unique code in the two fields, together with the amount of WAXP you wish to transfer.

![WAXP withdrawal](images/binance-waxp-withdraw.png)

**Make sure you surely typed in your credentials, as a mistake would mean you are not getting your money back!**

Next, head over to your WAX wallet and wait for the WAXP to arrive.

# How to start out in Alienworlds (Guide)

Finally we can start playing! The good news is, that this setup is only required once, and after that starting into new games becomes way easier.

Head over to the [Alienworlds app](https://play.alienworlds.io/), and create a new character.

The gameplay of Alienworlds is to mine resources on different planets, and later on battle against other players. To mine equipment is used, which is represented in the form of NFTs. At the beginning, each player owns a basic shovel, which is okay for the start, but not enough if you really want to start making progress. 

The main things to be mined are for one new NFTs, and on the other hand Trilium (TLM), which is the native token of Alienworlds. And now for the amazing thing about Crypto gaming: You could convert the TLM you haved mined to actual Euro or Dollar! Amazing times, that is play-to-earn in action.

At the beginning, I would recommend going for NFTs, as this could result in better "miners", which then can finally be used to extract Tilium.

The economics of Alienworlds can fill books, and if you want to dive into more detail head over to Youtube for some amazing tutorials. The purpose of this guide is to keep it short though, and to get you started quickly. 

In order to start mining you will need to select first a planet, and then a parcel (again an NFT) where you want to mine.

## How to choose the planet in Alienworlds

Luckily, there is a handy website which shows where most of the TLM is currently located at.

[https://wax.stats.eosusa.news/d/g-n07fbGz/alienworlds-planet-info](https://wax.stats.eosusa.news/d/g-n07fbGz/alienworlds-planet-info?orgId=1&refresh=30s)

![Website showing where the most TLM is located at](images/alienworlds-where-to-mine.png)

You basically just have to pick the planet which has the highest value, in this case "Neri".

## How to choose the land or parcel on your Alienworlds planet

Next, you want to choose the right location in order to maximize profit. 
First, you will have to decide if you want to max out on TLM- or NFT-mining.
As I recommended NFT mining for the beginning, I will describe that process.

The math behind this is complex, but again some websites will save us the work.

First, head over to [https://alienworlds.tools/](https://alienworlds.tools/), in which you have to insert the tools you currently own. If you just started out, this will most likely be the "Stone Shovel". As stated above, this is fine for starting out, but if you want a headstart I will describe how to get the optional starter set for NFT mining next.

### (optional) Buying yourself a nice starterset for NFT mining 

Long story short, the best cheap tool for NFT mining is the so called "Draxos Axe". You can equip three of them in total for one mining spot, and at the time of writing this set cost around 60$. You can purchase NFTs at [Atomichub](https://wax.atomichub.io/explorer/template/alien.worlds/19562), which is a marketplace for NFTs on the WAX chain. 
It connects to your WAX wallet as well, so if you click on "Login", you should see your current WAXP balance. 

If you want to buy the **Draxos Axe**, type that name into the search bar and select the "Stone" one. If you click on "Buy", the cheapest offer of another player is automatically selected, which was in my case 64 WAXP.

![Draxos Axe](images/draxos-axe.png)

Buy three to maximize NFT mining.

### Calculating the land type to mine with your NFT set

Heading back to the [https://alienworlds.tools/](https://alienworlds.tools/) website, insert Draxos Axe three times, and click on the "compare build on all lands" button.

![Alienworlds Tool Calculatot](images/alienworlds-luck-calculator.png)

The result is a list, which can be sorted by several settings. To max out on profit, you would want to sort by NFT/Min. If you are looking for the perfect mining spot later on the sort by would be "TLM/Min".

![Alienworlds where to mine for maxmimum NFTs](images/alienworlds-luck-calculator-2.png)

In my case this has been **Sandy Coastline**, with 21 minutes per charge. This means every 21 minutes you will be able to "mine" and collect rewards.
Keep in mind though, that this requires a manual action. Meaning if you do not have too much time to play the game, you would want to sort by "just" NFT (without minute), and check for a time window that is acceptable for you. There are other NFTs as well, which are optimal for mining during longer time windows, but as a rule of thumb the more frequent you play the higher the rewards.

Next, we will have to check if that land is available on the planet. Scrolling a little up allows you to select the land type next to your NFTs. If you remember from above, we planned to mine on Neri, as this is the planet with the biggest TLM rewards. Unfortunately "Sandy Coastline" is not available on that planet though, so I had a look at the TLM distribution again and selected "Veles" as my target. 

### Choosing the right place on the planet knowing our land type

Now that we know which land type we require, we can check which land is ideal for us.
Land itself is an NFT, and can be owned by people. They can then select how much commission they want to charge for mining. Some charge nothing, but most of the good ones charge 20%. 

Luckily, there is a tool for that as well!

Head over to [http://awstats.io/land/table](http://awstats.io/land/table), and type in the land type you want to filter for.

![Alienworlds stats](images/alienworlds-stats.png)

Then, sort by "NFT", and select something with a good balance of the NFT value and commission. In my case, I have selected the 109951... parcel by goodvibescmv. If you have made your selection, head back to the alienworlds app again, and select your planet as well as your parcel (there is an owner search).

Once you are at the parcel, you can then equip your equipment (the shovel, or 3x Draxos Axe).
At the top of the screen you will see a bar saying "Mine" or "Next mining attempt" together with a time. 
This time should be the same as in your calculator from above (27 min in my case).
As soon as the time reaches zero, you will be able to mine. Once you have pressed the mine button, the WAX wallet will open and ask for a signature. The signature is basically the collection of mining rewards.
Have a look at your TLM balance in the game, or the inventory to check out if you got any rewards.

Congratulations! You have officially started your first NFT game! Play around a bit, or head over to our [/blog](/blog) to discover further articles.
