## what do I need to get started with crypto games?

If you already own crypto the process is quite straight-forward. If not, you would first need to trade your local currency to crypto, and then buy NFTs of that game on a matching marketplace. As I found the process quite confusing, I have decided to add a little step-by-step guide on a real world example that you know from our previous tutorials: Axie Infinity!

To be more technical, the team of Axie Infinity has created an own network called "Ronin", which is basically a sidechain of Ethereum, but with lower Gas fees. It was created because the current gas prices (transaction fees) of Ethereum became quite high, and one transaction costing 20$ is not at all sustainable for gaming! The Ronin network of Axie's team is way cheaper and allows for cheap transactions.

Therefore you will need to "transfer" your Ethereum to the Ronin network, for which you will get wETH, which is a token representing your ETH on the Ronin network. Think of it as your ETH being "parked" on the Ethereum mainnet, and of wETH as the key to get it back. But keep in mind, if you loose your wETH your ETH on the mainnet is lost as well!

So if you already own wETH or ETH skip the next section, but if you do not own any crypto yet let us buy some!

## (optional) buy yourself some crypto!

As Axie Infinity is running on the Ethereum (ETH) platform, you will require (w)Ethereum to buy Axies. To get Ethereum, you will need to go to a platform that converts your local currency (FIAT) to Crypto. The bad news is, that this requires a lot of verification. The good news is: Register now, and during the time it takes to get activated have a look around the Crypto Gaming scene, try some stuff out already and think about your ideal setup!

So, what are the best platforms to buy crypto? This could be an article on its own, but let me break it down to these two:

1. [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355)
2. Coinbase

How did I end up choosing these? They are the biggest exchanges to date, and even though smaller exchanges might offer better rates, they are also more vulnerable, whilst these two have a track record of years, and already resisted a lot of hacking attempts. Now one could argue that if they are bigger, more hackers will try to attack them - which is true - but it also shows that they are investing a lot into security, as this would be their death. Additionally, at least in my opinion, the chance that they "run off" with all that money is slim, as they are actually earning more in the long run compared to a short-time shady scheme.

### step by step instructions to open an Account

I will provide an example of Binance, but the steps for coinbase are basically the same.

![Binance Registration](images/binance-registration-1.png)

1. Head over to [Binance](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355)
2. Click on "register"
3. You will then be asked to verify your Email, Phone and ID
4. This process can take some time, but once you are done you should see the following screen:

### Buying Crypto with Fiat Currency in your account

Next, click on [Buy Crypto](https://www.binance.com/en/fiat/deposit/EUR?ref=37092355)/Deposit, which should take you to this screen:

As you can see, several options are offered, which I will describe in a little more detail:

**1. Bank Card (Visa/MC)**

- Instant, which is cool, but a 1.8% fee
- 1.8% can be a lot, I would not recommend it except you really want to start

**2. Bank Transfer (SEPA) - (recommended if you have time)**

- 0% fee, but takes 2-3 business days
- Probably the most "normal" way to transact money from your account

**3. Advcash (Instant SEPA) - (recommended if you do not have time)**

- 1â‚¬ fee, instant if your bank supports instant sepa (google 'YOURBANK instant sepa')
- Good solution for instant payments, but keep in mind that you need to register and verify on Advcash as well, and Advcash has payment limits (10k/month, 1k a day)

**4. P2P Express (not recommended)**

- Leave this out if this is your first crypto purchase
- It has basically zero fees, and it usually offers the cheapest conversion rate, but it is Person to Person, offering a lot of possibility for complications, scam and tax authority problems
- You are basically sending your money to a stranger who then pays you crypto 

### Converting your FIAT currency to Axie's currency (WETH)

The good thing about binance is, that we can skip the step of buying ETH itself. This is good, as ETH's transactions are quite expensive, and we can directly convert to wETH and send it to the Ronin network.

The fastest and easiest way to convert is to use the "default" Binance [convert link](https://www.binance.com/en/convert?ref=37092355), but if you are willing to tinker a bit you might get a better price on the [classic trade screen](https://www.binance.com/en/trade/BTC_USDT?ref=37092355).
