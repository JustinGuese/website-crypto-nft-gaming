# Everything You Need to Know about Play to Earn: NFT Games 

Play to earn games are a new form of monetization on the blockchain. They give players an incentive to play and earn tokens, which can then be used as currency in other games, traded for Ethereum, or cashed out into fiat currencies like US dollars.

This article will explain what is Play to Earn and how it works. We will also talk about some of the benefits of Play to Earn games, explore some use cases, and discuss some of the best NFT play to earn games in the market.

## What is "Play to Earn”? How it Works?

The term "Play to Earn" is a growing trend in the gaming industry. It refers to games where the rewards from an activity are directly proportional to how much time you spend doing that activity. Play to Earn games are designed such that players can earn rewards from playing them and then use those rewards to play even more. In other words, these types of games encourage users to play for longer periods of time in order to earn more in-game items or continue progressing farther with their character.

This game design typically comes in two forms: user micro-transactions and flat rate payouts. NFTs have found success with both designs, but some prefer one over the other depending on their goals and desired type of player experience.

In order to earn in NFT, you must first join the [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) as a player. Once you have registered and have logged in, you can start playing games to earn NFT. The amount of NFT you can earn will depend on the game you are playing and your level of skill. In some games, you can even earn NFT just for playing.

## The Play-To-Earn Game Explained & What It Means for Your Game Design Strategy

If you're a game designer, you're probably always on the lookout for new and innovative ways to keep your players engaged. One method you may not have considered is called "play-to-earn."

 In a nutshell, play-to-earn games reward players for spending time playing the game. The more time players spend playing, the more rewards they earn. This could be in the form of experience points, in-game currency, or other rewards that can be used in the game. The basic premise is that players are more likely to keep playing if they know there's a tangible reward waiting for them at the end. 

## There are a few different ways to implement play-to-earn mechanics into your game. 

One common method is to use a "milestone" system. With this system, players earn rewards for reaching certain milestones. For example, they may earn a new weapon or armor piece after reaching level 10, or a new character customization option after reaching level 20.

Another common method is to use a "badge" system. With this system, players earn badges for completing certain tasks or objectives. For example, they may earn a badge for killing 10 enemies, or for completing a level without taking any damage.

## There are a number of benefits to using a play-to-earn game mechanic.

 First, it encourages players to spend more time playing the game. This is especially true if the rewards are desirable and/or valuable.

 Second, it encourages players to try new things. If they want to earn the best rewards, they'll need to try new things and explore the game world. 

Third, it encourages players to team up with others. If players want to earn the best rewards, they'll need to work together with others. 

Fourth, it encourages players to return to the game frequently. If players know there's always something new to earn, they're more likely to come back and play more often. 

Finally, it can help keep players engaged for longer periods of time. Once players have earned all the rewards they're interested in, they may continue playing in order to improve their character or compete with others.

## Benefits of Play to Earn games

Play to earn games have been around since the early 2000s. But they are now more prevalent than ever before. The idea behind it is simple. Players get to play a game and earn rewards in the form of points or other in-game items that they can redeem for prizes like gift cards, game credits, or money.

There are many benefits to this type of gaming. It not only provides entertainment for people, but it also teaches users about budgeting, rewards and how to work towards goals that will eventually lead them to gain more in-game items which will offer them even better rewards. Play to earn games are a great way for many companies and organizations to do marketing without having the player feel like they are being marketed too aggressively because the player gets some form of reward out of playing.
