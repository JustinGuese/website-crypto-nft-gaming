# How Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) Can Improve the Game User Experience

##  What are Non-Fungible Tokens and what are they used for?

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new form of digital asset that is used to represent ownership of an object or collectible. NFTs are not interchangeable and can be used as a form of currency, to track ownership, or to identify the owner. They are created on the blockchain and can be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.

This article will walk you through What Ethereum Tokens are, How NFT Works, How NFTs and Blockchain Related to each other and Their Potential Uses in Gaming.

## What is an Ethereum Token?

An Ethereum token is a digital asset that can be traded, transferred, or sold. The most popular use of an Ethereum token is to represent a tradable asset. Ethereum tokens are created using smart contracts. They are based on the ERC-20 standard and they have a few common features:

## They are fungible, meaning they can be freely exchanged without any difference in value between the tokens;

They are divisible, meaning they can be split into smaller units;

## They have a limited supply that cannot be changed;

Only their creator has the power to create new tokens and destroy them.

## How Do NFTs Work in Games?

NFTs are one of the most interesting and important applications of blockchain technology. They offer a new way for people to interact with games, but also a new way for players to have ownership over the items they collect in games.

Cryptocurrency games are a relatively new phenomenon that is on the rise. The idea is that players can buy, sell, and trade in-game items using cryptocurrencies instead of fiat money. This means that you can use your Bitcoin or Ethereum to purchase something in a game like CryptoKitties or Ethermon.

Ethereum Games are built on top of the Ethereum blockchain and require ether (ETH) as an input to generate an output (e.g., an item). It’s important to note that these games do not require ETH as an input (rather, they require ETH as an output).

## NFTs and Blockchain Gaming – How Are They Related?

NFTs and Blockchain Gaming are both part of the new wave of gaming technology. They are concepts that have been around for a while, but these technologies have never been available to the wider public until now.

The relationship between NFTs and Blockchain gaming is a bit more complicated. Cryptokitties, an Ethereum game that went viral because of the popularity of the digital collectibles it uses, is not just any game. It has a level of depth that is unheard of in most other games.

Cryptokitties allows players to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) and sell these digital collectibles for fiat money as well as for cryptocurrency. Inventory and contract ownership are both recorded on the blockchain- this means that players can buy, sell, trade and exchange their precious kitties easily without having to trust one another or worry about fraud or theft.Players are also able to create new cryptokitties with genetic information pulled from the blockchain itself, something that other game designers can’t do with NFTs. 

## What You Should Know About NFTs and Their Uses in Games

NFTs stands for non-fungible tokens, which are tokens that represent individual units or collectibles with intrinsic and specific value. They are a very attractive concept as they introduce new ways to monetize games and gaming content. On the other hand, NFTs were recently introduced in Ethereum protocol that can be used to store every type of digital asset in one place on the blockchain.

People create their accounts in Ethereum's public ledger to issue their NGs like shares of stocks or bonds. Their transactions take a fraction of a cent and there are very few fees involved to the token creators; if you care about reducing the costs for your transactions, this is something that you should take into consideration.
