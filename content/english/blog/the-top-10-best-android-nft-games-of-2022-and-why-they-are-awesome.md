# The Top 10 Best Android NFT Games of 2022 and Why They Are Awesome

## Introduction: What is an Android NFT Game?

Android games can be counted as the most popular category of games in the mobile platform. A modern mobile game might take a lot of different forms, but some of the common factors are that they usually require some kind of input from their players, and that they are usually casual games which can be played for a few minutes at a time.

An Android NFT Game is an Android game designed to interact with physical objects. This is mostly done through NFC technology which enables objects and devices to communicate with each other by touching them together or bringing them into close proximity with one another.
