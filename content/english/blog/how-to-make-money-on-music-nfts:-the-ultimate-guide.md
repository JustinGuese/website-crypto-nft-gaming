# How to Make Money on Music NFTs: The Ultimate Guide

## Introduction: What is a Music Nft and how does it Work?

NFT is a type of smart contract that can be used by artists, labels, and music platforms to manage the rights to their songs. It also provides a way for artists to share revenue with rights holders.

The first music nft was created in 2017 by blockchain startup Mediachain Labs. Since then, many other music companies have begun using the technology as well. These include major labels like Sony Music Entertainment and Universal Music Group as well as independent record labels like Downtown Records and Matador Records.

NFTs are not only used for music but also for other types of intellectual property including books, film scripts, and software code.

Nft tokens provide artists with multiple benefits; such as, allowing them to create, distribute, and earn from their own unique intellectual property (IP). This also allows users to use artist-generated nfts for purchases as well as for crowd funding. 

On the other hand, the benefits of using nft tokens for artists and brands are that artists can earn revenue from their artworks without any additional effort. This is because the blockchain technology allows them to create a digital asset, which is then sold to the public.

Nft tokens are also useful in terms of marketing. They allow brands to promote their products and services without having to spend money on traditional advertising methods.
