# Earn Passive Income with NFTS: The Complete Guide

## Introduction to the NFTs Protocol

What are NFTs?

NFTs are non-fungible tokens which can be either unique or non-unique. The way they work is very similar to how crypto currencies work in general.

This is because NFTs represent ownership over assets digitized on the blockchain.

The worth of an NFT token can vary based on what it represents and its rarity which is determined by its number of units in circulation. For example, if there are only two copies available and one is sold, then the other copy would be worth much more than it was before because only one copy remains available for purchase.
