## What is Crypto Mining and What is Blockchain?

Crypto mining is the process of adding transactions to a blockchain. It is done by solving mathematical problems and verifying transactions. These are called blocks.

## Blockchain is a public, distributed ledger that records transactions in chronological order.

The first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin, which was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group of people under the name Satoshi Nakamoto.

Bitcoin is considered to be the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central repository or single administrator.

The most important feature of Bitcoin is that it doesn't have a centralized authority or any middlemen to handle transactions between users. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called blockchain. The system also has built-in protection against double-spending and frauds such as chargebacks (where someone disputes a transaction with their credit card provider) which affects both the seller and the buyer.

## How to Mine Bitcoin at Home Like a Pro?

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system. It is the first decentralized digital currency, as the system works without a central bank or single administrator.

On the other hand, Bitcoin mining is done by running SHA256 double round hash verification processes in order to validate Bitcoin transactions and provide the requisite security for the public ledger of the Bitcoin network. Miners are rewarded with transaction fees and newly created bitcoins.

The purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a "subsidy" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system through mining.
