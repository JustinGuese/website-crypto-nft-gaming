# Alien World NFT – A Guide to the Mysterious, New and Exciting Platform

In this article, we will cover What Alien World NFT Is and How It Works. We will also cover the Tokenomics of Alien Worlds and How to Buy Alien Tokens.

## What is an Alien Worlds NFT?

An Alien Worlds NFT is a customized, limited edition collectible card that can be obtained by using the Alien Worlds mobile app. The cards, which come with a unique alien world as well as other goodies such as exclusive digital content or in-game currency, can be traded and collected like any other card game.

The use of an nft to interact with games and giveaways creates a new way for developers to incentivize players to engage with their games more often.

## How does it work?

Alien Worlds is a 3D ico game. The game is set in a futuristic world where the player needs to explore the planet and find precious minerals.

The player can choose to play as either an alien or human. Alien characters are stronger, faster, and have better weapons than humans do. Humans are more vulnerable but they have more resources at their disposal.

The game also has an asset marketplace where players can trade with each other. Alien Worlds is currently in open beta testing phase (currently available for Android users only).

## What is Alien Worlds Tokenomics?

Alien Worlds Tokenomics is an ecosystem designed to incentivize and reward developers, gamers, and content creators in a way that has never been seen before. It is also one of the first decentralized games that will be an open world sandbox MMO (Massively Multiplayer Online) with AI player NPCs and advanced scripting.

On the other hand, Alien Worlds Tokenomics consists of two major components: The Creative Economy and the Gaming Economy. The Creative Economy provides users with a chance to earn ALIEN tokens through their creative talents. The Gaming Economy provides users with a chance to earn ALIEN tokens by playing games on Alien Worlds.

## How to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) alien tokens?

There are two ways to [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) alien tokens. One is to purchase them with fiat currency using an exchange and the other is to receive them for free by participating in airdrops.
