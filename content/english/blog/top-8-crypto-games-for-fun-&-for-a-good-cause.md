# Top 8 Crypto Games for Fun & For a Good Cause

## Crypto is Here to Stay, But What's the Best Way to Participate?

Trading, Mining, Investing

In the past year alone, the crypto market has seen a whopping $700 billion of market capitalization. That’s an average of $2 billion every day. As more and more people heard about crypto and began to invest their savings in it – they recorded their success stories on social media outlets like YouTube and Reddit. The enthusiasm reached its peak during this year’s bull run – with Bitcoin selling for around $19k USD per coin. However - no coin is immune from falling. Crypto volatility has been at an all-time high in 2018 with coins losing up to 80% of their value overnight. This year witnessed Bitcoin’s biggest pullback ever - with the coin losing over 60% of its value from its all-time-high. So, what does this mean for those who are just starting out in the crypto world?
