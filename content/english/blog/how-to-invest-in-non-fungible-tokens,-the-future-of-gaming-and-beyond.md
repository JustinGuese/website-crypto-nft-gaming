# How to Invest in Non-Fungible Tokens, the Future of Gaming and Beyond

## Introduction: What are NFTs?

Non-fungible tokens are in-game items that are unique, meaning that each one is assigned a distinct identity. Unlike traditional video game items, NFTs cannot be broken down into smaller parts and players cannot trade them with other players.

Non-fungible tokens have many applications outside of just games. They can be used to create a digital art collection without the hassle of storing the physical goods or tracking when an item changes hands. They can also be used in different forms of digital collectibles such as cryptokitties and rare pepe cards.

## What are the potential investment opportunities in NFT games?

Non-Fungible Tokens are unlike utility tokens. They are built on top of some other existing [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) that supports the development that enables users to trade and own their tokens. NFTs are similar to cryptocurrencies in the way they offer an open and transferable token, but there is a difference. 

NFTs don't have a fungible value, which means that one token cannot be substituted for another of identical characteristics (i.e., one digital collectible card can't replace another digital collectible card). In short, they're assets with a unique identity which make them valuable to the owner. Investment opportunities come as various types of assets may develop over time, including but not limited to: game studios, game development tools and hardware, non-fungible tokens issued on blockchain platforms, esport teams and leagues.

## Recent Trends in Cryptoeconomics & How They Impact Gaming

Cryptoeconomics is a field emerging from crypto games that uses game theory and economics to design fair mechanisms for incentivizing desired behaviors. This can range from placing high scores on a leaderboard to catching more Pokémon’s. The key to cryptoeconomics is that it can create systems in which the participants are incentivized to act in the way that the game designer desires. These systems can be incredibly complex, but the basic idea is that players are rewarded for desirable actions and punished for undesirable actions.

 One of the most important aspects of cryptoeconomics is that the incentives are transparent. Players know exactly what they need to do to receive rewards and they know what will happen if they act in an undesirable way. This helps to ensure that the game is fair and that players are not taking advantage of the system. Cryptoeconomics is still a relatively new field, and there are many unexplored possibilities. However, it has already shown promise in helping to create fair and engaging games.

## Non-Fungible Tokens as an Asset Class & Potential Investment Opportunities

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are a new kind of cryptocurrency that is used in video games. The tokens represent an asset or item that cannot be used by someone else. NFTs are not fungible because they can be customized to represent anything from a weapon, to a rare cosmetic, to a virtual land.

NFTs have been around for only 3 years but they have already been adopted by some of the most popular video game titles such as CryptoKitties and Decentraland. The potential investment opportunities in NFTs are huge and it is not hard to see why: the gaming industry is worth over $137 billion and its growth rate is at 5% per year which means that it will reach $180 billion by 2020.

## The Future of Video Games as Decentralized Games on Blockchain Technology

Blockchain technology has shown the potential to revolutionize the gaming industry by creating a decentralized ecosystem where players can have ownership of their digital goods and developers are rewarded for their hard work.

Conclusion/Outlook: Cryptoeconomics is changing the world as we know it and with it comes a whole new paradigm of opportunities.

 This is a new world that's being created. It's a world where we are going to have to think about things in different ways. And it's a world where the old rules don't apply anymore.

The future of cryptoeconomics is very bright. It will continue to grow as the world becomes more and more digitalized. As time goes on, it is inevitable that cryptoeconomics will play a larger role in our lives.
