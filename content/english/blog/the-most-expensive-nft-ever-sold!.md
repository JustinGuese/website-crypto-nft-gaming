## History of the CryptoKitty

The CryptoKitty is a digital asset that was created by the game company, Axiom Zen. In the game, players [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) and collect digital assets that they can use to build their own unique kitties.

CryptoKitty is a virtual cat that players can buy, collect and trade on the Ethereum blockchain. The first CryptoKitty was sold in October 2017 for 0.001 ether (about $4).

The game has its own cryptocurrency called "cryptokitties" which can be bought with ether to purchase more rare cats or breed them with other cats to create new ones.

It's been a whirlwind ride for CryptoKitties, the digital asset that comes out of a partnership between the San Francisco-based blockchain company Axiom Zen and Vancouver-based developers, Nerdist Industries.

In the last few weeks, people have been looking at CryptoKitties as a one-of-a-kind project that gained attention in only six days. The team behind the digital assets has stated that they want to try new ways to make virtual reality more interesting.

The idea for Crypto Kitties was born when Axiom Zen co-founder and CEO Chris Matthieu Rotschild was challenged by his friend Jeremy Kauffman to build an 'easter egg' within his game Kingdom Death: Monster Manual 2. This 'easter egg' would be an ultra-rare monster that could only be found by taking specific, convoluted actions within the game. Inspired by the challenge, Matthieu set out to create a new kind of digital asset - one that was rare, beautiful, and nearly impossible to obtain. He called it a 'Crypto Kitty'. Crypto Kitties launched on November 28th, 2017, and within a week had become the most popular DApp on the Ethereum network, with over 1,500 transactions per day. The popularity of Crypto Kitties has continued to grow, with over 5.5 million Crypto Kitty transactions processed to date.
