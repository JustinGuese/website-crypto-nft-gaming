# How NFTs are Transforming the Gaming Industry and How You Can Use This Technology to Build Your Own Games

## Introduction: What Are Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) And Why Should You Know About Them?

Non-fungible tokens are like unique trading cards or other collectibles that can be used in place of traditional video game items. They provide a way for game developers to offer rare and one-of-a-kind items for gamers to use in their games. But why should you know about them? This article is going to explore the introduction of NFTs and what features they have to offer. 

This type of blockchain technology could change the gaming industry by providing new ways for players to interact with their favorite games and purchase items from in-game marketplace.

## What is an NFT?

An NFT is a Non-Fungible Token. It's a digital asset that is unique, meaning that it can't be replaced by another token of the same type. NFTs are most commonly known to work with ERC721 tokens which are governed by the Non-Fungible Interface (NIF). This interface allows for users to distinguish tokens from one another, and for each token to have unique attributes and values.

For example, if you were playing Pokemon Go, you would need your own unique ERC721 token in order to catch a rare pokemon.

## What Are Some Examples of Non-Fungible Tokens in Gaming?

There are many examples of non-fungible tokens in gaming including rare items, collectibles, and digital representation of real world objects. Some games use them as a form of in-game currency and others use them to provide players with unique benefits or abilities.

Non-Fungible tokens (NFTs) are one way for game developers to create a higher level of rarity for their game items. Recently, their popularity has become so popular that some game developers are starting to tokenize everything from the characters you play with to the levels you unlock within their games.

Here are some examples of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) games that are a digital representation of a user owning something.

Cryptokitties - Cryptokitties are a game which consists of virtual cats and some can be made rarer and valuable through breeding. In the game, each "kitty" is unique; meaning no two kitties will ever be the same - they each have their own set of genes that make them unique in some way

CryptoPunks - CryptoPunks is another blockchain-based game where users can trade and collect cryptopunks. These represent individual users who have been turned into cyphers in this game by the matron goddess of cryptopunks, The Oracle.

## Conclusion & Final Thoughts on Why Everyone Should Be Using NFTs in Their Games
