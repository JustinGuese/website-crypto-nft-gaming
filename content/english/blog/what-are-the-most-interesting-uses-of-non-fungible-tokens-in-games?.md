# What are the Most Interesting Uses of Non-Fungible Tokens in Games?

## Introduction to NFTs - What are they, and how can they be used in games?

Non-fungible tokens, also called NFTs, are a type of crypto token that are not fungible. In the world of crypto, a fungible token is something that is exchangeable with any other token of the same type. Whereas an NFT doesn't fit into this category because each replica is unique and cannot be exchanged with others; it has its own set qualities and traits.

In this article, we take a look at Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). We look at what they are and how they can be used in games.

## The 5 Most Exciting Uses for NFTs in Gaming

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are becoming very popular within the gaming community because they offer certain benefits which regular cryptocurrencies do not provide. The five most exciting uses for NFTs in gaming are:

1. Trading and Collecting One of the main benefits of NFTs is that they can be traded and collected like traditional collectible items. This means that gamers can buy, sell, or trade their NFTs with other gamers, which can add an extra level of excitement and competition to the gaming experience. 

2. Enhancing Gameplay NFTs can also be used to enhance the gameplay of certain games. For example, they can be used to unlock new levels, characters, or items within a game. This can make the gaming experience more immersive and exciting for gamers. 

3. Creating Unique Experiences NFTs can also be used to create unique gaming experiences that are not possible with regular cryptocurrencies. For example, they can be used to create virtual worlds or games that are only accessible to those who own a specific NFT. This can add an extra layer of excitement and intrigue to the gaming experience. 

4. Supporting Gamers’ Communities NFTs can also be used to support gamers’ communities. For example, they can be used to create virtual worlds where gamers can socialize and collaborate with each other. This can help gamers to build stronger relationships with each other and to have more fun while gaming. 

5. Monetizing Games NFTs can also be used to monetize games. This means that gamers can use them to purchase in-game items or features that would otherwise be unavailable to them. This can add an extra level of excitement and intrigue to the gaming experience.

## NFTs as Reward Systems/Collectibles

NFTs can be used in many different ways, with one example being providing rewards for players in a specific game. This reward system is ideal for online gaming because it allows players to retain their digital property for use outside of the game domain and gives game designers the ability to provide exclusive content without having to negotiate with a third party.

As well as this, NFTs can be used as collectibles that can be traded with other players or sold on an open market, such as an online auction site.

## NFTs as Game Currency & Store of Value

NFTs are unique in that they are digital items. Most of the NFTs in games can be bought and sold with a digital currency called “game coins” or "gold". However, some NFTs may be purchased with a different type of digital currency called "cryptocurrency".

NFTs in games play many diverse roles. They represent ownership and identity, allow players to create and customize their gameplay, act as an in-game form of cryptocurrency for buying and selling things online, enable players to earn passive income by renting out their assets for game play, and enable gamers to earn passive income from trading assets.

## NFTs as In-Game Items and Assets

NFT is a new technology that enables ownership and tradability of digital assets. NFTs can be used to represent any type of digital asset such as in-game items, virtual goods, crypto collectibles, loyalty points, etc.

Block chain-based games are one of the most popular use cases for this new technology. In these types of games, players find themselves in a massive multiplayer game world where they can purchase and trade virtual goods and in-game items with other players to enhance their gaming experience.
