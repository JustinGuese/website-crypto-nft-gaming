# What is Decentraland? And How Will It Change the Gaming Landscape?

## The Rise of Decentraland: The Future of Open-Source Immersive Virtual Reality

Decentraland is a virtual reality [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) that provides users with the opportunity to create their own 3D content. It is a decentralized VR world where users can buy, sell and share land parcels. Decentraland’s vision is to create a virtual world that is completely decentralized, meaning there are no central authorities or third-party entities that can control the content of the world or dictate how it evolves.

Users purchase land parcels in Decentraland and are free to build whatever they want on them. They can even rent out their land parcels in order to earn money from other people’s creations.

## How is Decentraland Better Than Other VR Gaming Platforms?

Decentraland is different than other VR gaming platforms because it doesn't use a centralized server to store user data, instead it uses blockchain technology. Decentraland's virtual world has no centralized server, which means that there are no single points of failure. Instead, all the content is stored on the blockchain and can be accessed by anyone with permission.

The way Decentraland works is that each parcel of land has its own set of rules for what can be built on it and what activities can take place there. These rules are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain and enforced by smart contracts so that everyone in the world knows them without having to trust any central authority.

## How Decentraland will Change the Gaming Landscape?

Decentraland is a virtual reality [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) powered by the Ethereum blockchain. It is designed to be a decentralized world where users can create, experience, and monetize content and applications.

The gaming landscape will change drastically in the future as Decentraland becomes more popular. This virtual reality [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) will allow users to create their own gaming worlds and enjoy them with other people from all over the globe.

We are witnessing an evolution of the gaming industry with the help of the blockchain technology. Blockchain is revolutionizing the way we play games and how we make money by playing them. With blockchain-based games, developers can create their own tokens and use them to reward players for completing certain tasks or winning a game.

More importantly, blockchain technology is enabling gamers to trade virtual items amongst themselves without involving third parties or centralized servers. This opens up a whole new world of possibilities for gamers and developers alike.

## The Future of Gaming with Decentraland

The future of gaming will be defined by the rise of virtual reality (VR) as a mainstream form of entertainment. The market for VR is expected to grow from $7.2 billion in 2017 to $143 billion by 2022. The Decentraland [ platform ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) will provide users with an immersive virtual world complete with its own economy, allowing them to create, experience and monetize content and applications without any centralized authority or middlemen.

Blockchain technology offers a lot of opportunities for game developers, players, and publishers. It has the potential to bring fairness and transparency in the gaming industry by removing intermediaries from transactions between players and developers. Blockchain technology also provides a secure way to store player data, which will make it easier for players to protect their privacy while playing games online.
