## The 3 Simple Steps to Start Earning Money with NFT

In this article, I will explain how you can make money online with NFT. We will discuss how to choose NFT products that you want to sell and how to find the right marketplace for your NFT products. We will also talk about how to promote and sell your NFT products online.

## Step 1: Choose What You Want To Sell 

One of the best ways to make money with NFT is to sell what you know. You can sell games, clothing, or even your own creations in order to make money.

The things that you would want to sell online with your NFT products might change based on your field. For example, if you are a writer, then you may have the option of uploading digital copies of your books for sale. If you are a photographer, then it is possible that you could upload prints for sale as well.

## Step 2: Find the Right Market Place for your NFTs products

The best marketplace for NFTs products is one that has a lenient policy where the seller can upload their products in any type of format. For example, on the OpenSea marketplace, when you upload a product, it automatically converts it to an ERC-721 token. This is not the case on other marketplaces like Decentraland and eBay. In this way, OpenSea is far better than them. 

## Here is the list of the best Marketplaces for NFTâ€™s Products:

1. OpenSea
2. TokenLister
3. RareBits
4. Decentraland

## Step 3: Promote and sell your NFT products online!

NFT have a lot of benefits, but you also need to make sure that people know about them. Free online marketing tools can help you do this.

Some online marketing tools like Crypto.com, Moby, Bit Degree and many others allow you to build your own landing pages, allowing users to directly purchase your products and services. They also provide useful insights on your audience, which can improve your marketing campaign and conversion rates.

This will provide a higher engagement rate and increase the likelihood of conversion.
