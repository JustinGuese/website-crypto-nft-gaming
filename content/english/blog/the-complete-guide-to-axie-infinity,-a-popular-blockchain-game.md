# The Complete Guide to Axie Infinity, a Popular Blockchain Game

## Introduction: What is Axie Infinity?

Axie Infinity is a blockchain game which provides a decentralized gaming experience. It is built on the Ethereum blockchain and so it’s totally secure and transparent.

It also has a very original artwork. It is set in the world of Axie, where you can collect, battle, trade and raise your own Axies.

Axie Infinity has been developed by the Singapore-based company Axie Group (founded by Jiawei Wang). They are backed by some big names like Coinbase, Binance, and others. With this backing from some big players in the crypto industry, their future doesn’t seem uncertain at all!

## What is the Purpose of the Game?

Axie Infinity is a blockchain-based game, where players are able to collect, trade and breed digital pets called Axies. The game has been designed to be a fun way to learn about blockchain technology.

The purpose of the game is to explore the world of blockchain by playing it. Players can also earn cryptocurrency by playing the game and use it in other games or platforms that support cryptocurrency.

## What are the Different Types of Axies in the Game?

Axies are the units used in the game. They have different types that each serve a different purpose.

The most common type of axie is the Warrior, which is what you start with. Warriors are mainly used to fight and kill other axies in order to gain territory. They are also able to use special abilities such as healing themselves or attacking all other axies on the board at once.

There are also many other types of axies that you can unlock through play, such as: Healers, Mages, Rogues and Knights. Healers heal your axie every turn and mages can cast spells that damage enemies and give buffs to allies. Rogues deal damage from afar with bows while knights deal melee damage with swords or axes.

## How Do You Get Axies and Store Them?

In Axie Infinity, there are two types of storage:

## The first type is the one that's in your home. You can store up to 100 different axies in your home.

The second type is the one that's on the blockchain. You can store up to 1000 different axies on the blockchain and you don't have any limitations on how many you can store.

You get axies by either getting them from friends, or by buying them for Axie Coins (AXE). When you [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) an Axie for AXE, it will be stored on the blockchain and it will be transferred to your account.

How to Participate in This Game and Become an Owner of a Smart Contract? (key words: owning a smart contract, how to get an axie)

The Axie ecosystem will use crypto-collectible type of tokens/tokens called Axies. You can [ buy ](https://accounts.binance.com/en/register?ref=37092355) these tokens during the sale, or after the sale in pairs with Bitcoin or Ethereum.

For anyone wanting to purchase Axie tokens before the token sale, you will need a Bitcoin or Ethereum wallet and an exchange account (exchanges which currently trade BTC/ETH include GDAX and Coinbase). Once you have purchased BTC or ETH on an exchange, you can send it over to your personal wallet (e.g., My Ether Wallet). To transfer your Ethereum to GDAX, go to "Transfer" on the left side bar under "Funds," then select "Ethereum (ETH)."

## You will also need a way to purchase Axies during the token sale by using either ether or bitcoin.

Conclusion and Future Plans for Development 

Axie Infinity will continue to develop their product and improve the user experience by adding new features such as new areas and battles, defensive tools, and collectibles. They are also looking forward to integrating with other projects in order to expand their ecosystem.
