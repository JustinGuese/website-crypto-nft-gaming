- title: "How Much Can I earn?"
  content: "This varies widely, depending on several factors we are exploring in another article. But let us look at an example of Axie Infinity, as it is one of the most established games right now. Of course, being an early adopter to a new game might make you a lot of money, but taking Axie as a starting point gives us a good overview of how much an average person might earn. In Axie you are breeding little Axies, which are NFTs, and players earn on average 9-13$ a day (300$/month). There are other possibilities to enhance this amount, with for example being a manager, or simultaneously staking, which results in an average of 66$/day or 2000$ a month."

- title: "How Much Does It Costs?"
  content: "This has been one of the biggest challenges right now. As popularity of NFT games increases, and as some games are getting more popular, even simple entry level NFTs cost over a hundred dollar. One has to keep in mind though, that they can still be sold after purchase, meaning as most games are stable or even uptrending in value, you are likely to get your investment back after playing. The difficult tradeoff in here is to look for new games, where NFTs are still relatively cheap, but also to not pick a game that is crashing in value during the next days. Looking at Axie Infinity again as an example, one can expect to pay around 300$ for a starter set, which is relatively safe as Axie is quite established, but therefore a steeper entry price."

- title: "What do I need?"
  content: "If you already own crypto the entry is quite easy. Oftentimes you can simply purchase an NFT with established coins like BNB, ETH or BTC, and start playing right away. If you do not own crypto yet, you will need to exchange your local FOREX currency (euro, dollar, ...) to crypto via a platform like Binance, and then transfer it to your wallet. Take a look at some of our articles that are explaining the process."

- title: "What is a hardware wallet?"
  content: "Hardware wallets are an additional security layer for your Crypto account. They kind of store the crypto password offline, such that in case your computer would get hacked hackers can not access the password. Think of it as a key that you are storing in a secure location."

- title: "Is it safe to invest in Crypto Games?"
  content: "Crypto games are never entirely secure. Crypto is a highly volatile asset that can crash at any moment. The past has shown that Crypto is highly volatile, meaning your entire savings could be wiped out in a second. Never invest more than you can. This website is purely informational and will not provide investment advice. Contact a professional investment advisor for additional information."

- title: "Why are you providing this information?"
  content: "We love Crypto Games ourselves, and it is definitely the future of Gaming, even crossing paths with the metaverse. Therefore Crypto Games will be a valid occupation in the future, and a new way to earn money whilst playing"
